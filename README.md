# NPM Base
## Bloomrix React Coaching Series (Session#4)

In session 4 of the Bloomrix React coaching series, we will start working on an example application named NPM Base that will make use of the npms.io api to allow users to search through npm packages and add packages that they like to their favorites list. The user will have the ability to add, or remove packages that they have liked so far. We will be using browser's local storage for storing the favorite list.
